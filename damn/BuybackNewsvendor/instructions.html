       You are the procurement manager of a large fashion retailer. You have to place the order for product "A".<p></p>
        Due to the long lead times you cannot reorder within a season. After the season product "A" will go out of fashion and has to be salvaged at a lower price.<p></p>
        For product "A" the demand is normally distributed with the mean {{C.MEAN}} and the standard deviation of {{C.STANDARDDIV}}.<p></p>
        The cost for each bought product for the buyer is {{C.WHOLESALE}}. The supplier earns that money and has to pay {{C.COST}} to produce each unit of product "A"<p></p>
        After the season ends you can salvage product A for {{C.SALVAGE}}. <p></p>
        The supplier can offer a buyback contract to the buyer. The buyer will then obtain the buyback value in addition to the salvage value.
        The supplier has to pay the buyback amount to the buyer for each piece left over at the end of the season.<p></p>
